          <p>
            UX Stands for <i>User Experience</i>, the users experience while using a website or application; the user's experience may be pleased if the website is organized and interactive with the user. 
          </p>
          <p>
            UI Stands for <i>User Interface</i>, the graphical desgin of an application or website; this is what the users sees while using the website, it is often colorful for better eye appeal.

          <h3><i>HTML</i></h3>
            <p>
              HTML or <i>HyperText Markup Language</i>, is a computer language used to describe a web page; because it is a markup language, it includes many tags that add elements to a page such as paragraphs and lists. HTML tells the web browser how everything is to be organized and like any other language includes numerous syntax. Without HTML the web page has no structure and therefore cannot exist.

          <h3><i>CSS</i></h3>
            <p>
              CSS or <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, manages the design and presentation of a web page. CSS controls the visual appeal to a viewer as it can change the color, border, font and much more. It is often the UI of a website and kept on a seperate file from the HTML. Think of HTML and CSS as a cake, HTML being the cake itself, the founation and stucture of the web page and CSS as the icing on the cake, what makes it visually appealing and colorful.

          <h3><i>Using "display" &amp; "clearfix" in CSS</i></h3>
            <p>
              The "display" element in CSS is used to prevent the parent element from ignoring the child elemnts properties such as width, margin, and padding. The "display" element is specified with either block or inline. Clearix is in CSS when multiple elements are floated within a parent. Often times the parent will ignore its child if multiple block elements are being floated. Clearix prevents the parent from collapsing on its children elements and stops it fro ignoring the different float commands. There are many clearfix codes, but most of them do the same thing even if they are a shortened code.

          <h3><i>Implementing different fonts into HTML and CSS</i></h3>
            <p>
              One way to implement a different font into HTML and CSS is to go to, "fonts.google.com"; here you will find a variety of fonts to choose from to match the theme/style of your page. Once you select the font, GoogleFonts will automatically give you a code to copy and paste into your HTML and CSS. The HTML code that the website gives you is simply an "href" linking the page to where the font lays within the website. The CSS code uses the "font-family" command specifying the family.

        <div class="article">
          <h3><i>Responsive Web Design</i></h3>
            <p>
              Responsive web desgin also known as fluid design is when one builds a website that responds to multiple sizes. The most common screen sizes are from desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets. By allowing a site to respond to multiple screen sizes, your website does not have overlapping elements when shrunk our expanded. Some popular examples of responsive web design are Google and Facebook. If you resize website, you'll notice how the elements shrink and don't overlap each other keeping everything neat and organized. This can be done using media queries which tells your design in CSS to change if a certain condition is met. For example, is the screen size shrinks below 500px, the background-color will automatically change to blue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mobile design is closely related to fluid design. These are web applications made to wrok for mobile. The term "mobile first" is commonly used as it scales a web application to mobile first. Therefore the media queries are set to change on the exapnsion of a screen size. One example of mobile design is Instagram; it simple to use and relies on expanding media queries. As mentioned above, media queries can be used to change a website based on screen size; however, em, a unit in CSS, can also be used to adjust the size of everything on the web page. It is usually based upon the font size. For example, if a child element is set at .5em and its parent size at 16px, .5em is actually 10px (16 x .5), this means the child element will always be half the size of its parent element.

          <h3><i>Using Media Queries</i></h3>
            <p>
              Media queries provides a way for the web browser to change its content based on the size of the browser width; this is commonly used for designing "mobile first" web pages and is a part of responsive desgin. In CSS media queries use the @media command to define the pages break points; it has a minimum and a maximum width or height. Width is more commonly used over height because it changes much more drastically when resizing the page. The breakpoints can be the widths of different screen sizes usually consisting of a smartphone size (usually 320px minimum), a tablet size (768px minimum), and desktop/laptop computer sizes (1224px minimum). To incorporate these three breakpoints, the smallest size (smartphone) should always be set at a <b>maximum</b> size; this is so that the browser knows that if the width is over 500 pixels, then the webpage being displayed is not on a smartphone but rather on maybe a tablet; thus the webpage changes to the properties set at the tablet media query. The middle size (tablet) should have a <b>minimum and a maximum</b>; for example, the minimum may be 768px min, and 1200px max. That way if the web browser size is between this range, it knows that it's being displayed on a tablet, and its contents will conform to the properties set. And finally, the last size (desktop/laptop) should be set at a <b>minimum</b> pixel width. Any size over the minimum width, the browser knows to display its contents in a desktop format.

          <h3><i>Variables, Functions, and Console.log</i></h3>
            <p>
              In short, JavaScript is another programming language that provides the functionality for a web page. Unlike HTML which provides the structure/foundation and CSS, the look/design of the wbe page, JavaScript adds animations, and in a way is the UX. JS uses logic, variable, and functions to run its script all of which are done on a seperate stylesheet linked to the HTML. <b>Variables</b> are containers for storing data values. An example of a variable string is, var = "HelloWorld"; of course there are many different data values such as booleans, numbers, strings, null, and more but I won't overwhelm you right now. <b>Functions</b> can also be found in JavaScript. Like a regular function, it takes inputs and returns an output. Functions can vary from adding variables to checking if one thing is greater than another. Functions must always be <i>invoked</i>. This is calling out the function letting it know that it must run with the giving data. One final command in JavaScript is <b>console.log()</b>. Whatever is within the parenthesis of console log will be shown. It can be a message in <i>quotations</i> or the name of a function that is to run.

        <div class="article">
          <h3><i>If, Else If, Else</i></h3>
            <p>
              A conditional statement in JavaScript is found within a function. In proper syntax it should have a } followed by the conditional statement followed by { after the argument. Conditional statements will only run if a certain condition is met, for example, "<b>if</b> the number of aliens is less than 5000, do this..." The three main conditional statements are <b>if</b>, <b>else if</b>, and <b>else</b>. The if conditional statement runs a part of the function only if it is true or met. Unlike the else if statement, once the if statement is met preceeding conditional statements are not shown on the console. Else if statements runs a new code of script even if there are multiple conditionals. Therefore, any else if statement that is met, will be shown on the console. The else statement runs only if the "if" conditional statement turns out false. This is useful for making an action occur when one condition isn't met making the function always give an output. Conditional statements can be linked with &amp;&amp;, || and can also execute functions or return a string. In total, conditional statements are good for having multiple outputs for one input in a function.

         <h3><i>Creating an App Idea</i></h3>
           <p>
             In our school we found that there was a lack of communication between club leaders and their members. Not only was this problem within clubs, but also between students and faculty at school. Our app, SchoolComm, solves this problem by allowing club leaders to create notification that automatically send to its group members whenever there is an event such as a meeting. This app also includes important school information such as upcoming events and even the school lunch. I would improve our app concept video by taking more time to film certain parts to make it more eye appealing; as well as add new scenes to extend the video to the proper film requirement. Our current app feautures include the school lunch menu, a chat room and hybrid, a calender that auto reminds students about upcoming meetings or events. We would also like to add a feauture where students can create forums and surveys to give feeback to staff about campus improvements such as better bathrooms or cleaner water fountains. Our team face challenges including finding a good day to meet. I also found that our team lacked a strong leader and therefore we didn't have a drive to get things done on time nor a sense of organization. Next time I would probably create a better app idea and leade my own group so I wouldn't encounter problems on organization or lack of a team leader.

          <h3><i>What I Accomplished</i></h3>
            <p>
              This year I learned a lot about coding. Within one semester we went from HTML to JavaScript to combining all these languages together to create a functional web page. My most recent project, the fortune cookie generator (which you should check out at my repo because I worked very hard on it ;) ), combined all my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              HTML is the structure of the web page and creates elements that text or images can be put in. CSS is the styling of the page making what would look plain look colorful and nice. JavaScript adds the functionality to web page creating functions and variables that may randomize, or display/change an element. Overall, I have found much passion into coding and can see it as a possible future career. I had also created a git repo that displays all my work and projects, as well as learned to us git command in git shell. In total, I've enjoyed this past semester and look forward to the future and learning even more about programming like jQuery.
