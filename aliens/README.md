Aliens are invading! There are blue, green, and red aliens. 

The total amount of aliens there are is 10,000. 

Create variables with this information, and set up a series of conditional statements such that:

First, check if there are 10,000 aliens. 
Then, if there are more than 5,000 green aliens, console.log "MOTHER OF GOD, not the green ones"

If there are more than a total of 8,000 green and red aliens combined, console.log
"DOOOOOM"

If there are not more than 3000 red and blue aliens combined, console.log

"We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDANCE DAY!"

You may assign the alien amounts yourself, but the total must add up to ten thousand!
